\section{Application: secure indexes in \emph{Encrypted Search}}
enables untrusted systems to map \glspl{gls-key} to \glspl{gls-value}
obliviously search documents on behalf of authorized users, where the search query, the confidential documents being searched over, and the search results are equivalent to a random bit sequence.

These requirements may not be fully met in most cases. In this paper, we consider the confidentiality of a document which can be obviously searched.

the untrusted system does not know what the user is searching for, nor what the confidential documents contain. an obvious search is one in which the untrusted system does

One of the earlier papers presented on \gls{es} \cite{Son00} observed that individuals may wish to outsource storage logistics to cloud storage providers but do not trust the providers with confidentiality requirements. 
To enable an untrusted system to search a confidential document on an authorized user's behalf, the untrusted system must have some sort searchable representation of the document. 

Rank-ordered search. Oblivious sets are more appropriate for Boolean search.
